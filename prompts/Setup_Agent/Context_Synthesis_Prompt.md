# APM v0.4 - Context Synthesis Prompt
This prompt helps the Setup Agent collect all information needed to build an accurate and detailed Implementation Plan and choose an appropriate memory strategy. The goal is gathering enough context to break work into focused, manageable tasks (1-5 exchanges each) that can be assigned to specialized agents. At this stage, the Setup Agent passes control flow to this prompt.

## Principles for Discovery & Objectives

### Discovery Methodology
- Aim for clarity and sufficiency for task breakdown, not exhaustive interrogation
- Reuse existing documentation before asking new questions  
- Adapt language and depth to project size, type, and user expertise
- Combine related questions to reduce turns and maintain context efficiency
- Control flow must return to Setup Agent after at most 6–7 user exchanges

### Context Retention for Task Planning
As you gather responses, internally note planning implications for the structured work breakdown that follows:

#### Complexity Awareness
When user describes challenging/complex aspects → Flag these areas for careful breakdown for later planning
When user expresses uncertainty about approach → Note investigation and research needs for planning phase
When user mentions "first this, then that" or similar phrases or patterns → Retain sequential workflow patterns
When user describes parallel work streams or independent deliverables → Retain concurrent workflow patterns for flexible task assignment

#### Work Organization Memory  
When user explains independent vs dependent work → Remember workflow relationships and dependencies for planning
When user describes different skill areas → Retain domain boundaries for agent assignment decisions
When user mentions external dependencies → Flag coordination and environment needs for planning
When user identifies bottlenecks or critical path items → Note priority sequencing requirements for task ordering decisions
When user provides examples or references similar work → Capture relevant context for efficient informed planning decisions

#### Scope Understanding
When user describes deliverable scale → Carry forward scope implications for workload sizing
When user mentions timeline or other constraints → Retain urgency factors for planning decisions
When user identifies risk areas → Flag for extra attention during work breakdown
When user specifies quality standards or acceptance criteria → Preserve validation requirements for completion assessment planning

#### Process & Implementation Requirements
When user mentions specific workflow preferences or methodologies → Retain implementation approach requirements for task specification integration
When user describes quality standards, validation needs, or approval processes → Note explicit verification steps that could become task-level requirements
When user references formatting requirements, style guidelines, or consistency standards → Preserve as implementation constraints for task execution guidance
When user specifies delivery requirements, documentation standards, or output formats → Flag for integration into relevant task descriptions
When user describes tool preferences, environment constraints, or technical requirements → Note for task execution guidance and agent instruction specification
When user indicates tracking requirements, progress validation, or completion criteria → Note explicit review checkpoints as task-level or phase-level implementation requirements

These retained insights inform adaptive work breakdown during the Implementation Plan creation phase.

## Discovery Sequence
During project discovery, the Setup Agent must follow this sequence exactly:
**Phase 1 (single exchange) -> Phase 2 (adaptive follow-ups) -> Phase 3 (User requirements) -> Phase 4 (Project Breakdown Summary & Reiteration) -> Phase 5 (Confirmation & Asset format selection)**

### Phase 1: Existing Material and Vision  
1. Ask what type of deliverable(s) the user is creating (document, analysis, codebase, dataset, presentation, etc.).
2. Ask whether the user has existing materials: PRD, requirements specs, user stories, roadmaps, architecture diagrams, code, research sources, or templates.  
3. Ask for the user's current plan or vision if not covered by materials.
4. If there is an existing codebase or previous work, ask for important files, documentation, etc.

### Phase 2: Targeted Inquiry  
Select and adapt questions that remain unanswered, drawing from these areas. Use follow-up questions when user responses indicate relevant preferences or requirements.  

**Project Purpose and Scope**  
- What problem does the project solve? What defines success and completion?  
- What are the essential features, sections, or deliverables?  
- What skills/expertise areas does this involve? (writing, analysis, design, coding, research, visualization, etc.)
- *Follow-up if user mentions quality/completion standards: Are there specific quality standards, or validation criteria that define acceptable completion?*

**Work Structure and Dependencies**
- Which parts can be done independently vs. need sequential order?
- What are the most challenging or time-consuming aspects?
- Any dependencies between different parts of the work?
- What intermediate deliverables would help track progress?

- **Work Environment and Mental Model Requirements:**
  - Does this work involve different technical environments or platforms?
  - Are there distinct types of thinking required? (eg. creative design vs analytical vs technical implementation vs development vs research)
  - Which parts require deep domain expertise vs general implementation skills?
  - Are there natural handoff points where one type of work ends and another begins?

- **Execution and Coordination Requirements:**
  - Which deliverables can be prepared/built within development tools vs require external platform interaction?
  - What parts involve User-specific accounts, credentials, or manual coordination/configuration steps?
- *Follow-up if user mentions workflow complexity or coordination needs: Do you have preferred approaches for managing workflow, coordination between different work streams, or progress validation?*

**Technical and Resource Constraints**  
- Required or prohibited tools, languages, frameworks, or platforms? What is the intended tech stack/toolchain?  
- External resources needed? (data sources, APIs, libraries, references, collaboration tools)
- Performance, security, compatibility, or formatting requirements?  
- What is the deployment/delivery environment?

- **Platform and Access Requirements:**
  - What actions require access outside the development environment? (cloud dashboards, deployment platforms, external services)
  - Are there setup, configuration, or deployment steps that require specific account access or manual coordination?
  - Which parts of the work can be completed entirely within code/development tools vs require external platform management?
- *Follow-up if user mentions technical preferences or standards: Are there specific implementation preferences, style guidelines, or technical standards that should guide the work approach?*

**Timeline and Risks**  
- What is the target timeline or deadline?  
- What are the anticipated challenging areas or known risks?
- Any parts that require external input or review before proceeding?
- *Follow-up if user mentions reviews or external dependencies: Do you have preferred approaches for handling reviews, approvals, or validation checkpoints throughout the process?*

**Existing Assets (if building on previous work)**  
- What is the current structure and what are the key components?  
- What build systems, tools, or processes are currently used?  
- *Follow-up if user mentions existing standards or processes: Are there consistency standards, integration approaches, or existing methodologies that should be maintained or adapted?*

### Phase 3: User Requirements Verification
**Always ask these comprehensive questions** to ensure no critical User requirements are missed, regardless of previous responses:

"To ensure I have complete context for task planning:
- Are there specific workflow patterns, quality standards, or validation approaches you prefer for this type of work?
- Do you have particular technical constraints, implementation preferences, or tools that should guide the approach?  
- Are there coordination requirements, review processes, or approval gates that should be built into the work structure?
- Any consistency standards, documentation requirements, or delivery formats I should incorporate?
- Do you have examples, templates, or reference materials that illustrate your preferred approach?"

**Integration Requirement:**
Document all requirements (if any) as retained context for Implementation Plan creation.

### Phase 4: Work Breakdown Readiness Validation
**User Collaboration Point:** This is your opportunity to correct any misunderstandings before implementation planning begins.

#### Summary for User Validation
Present comprehensive summary covering:
- Work domains and complexity level identified: [Summarize the 3-5 major work areas and their difficulty]
- Critical dependencies and sequencing requirements: [Outline what must happen before what]  
- Implementation preferences and process requirements: [Detail any workflow, quality, or technical constraints captured]
- Complex/risky aspects requiring careful breakdown: [Highlight challenging areas that need extra attention]
- External coordination requirements: [Note any handoffs, approvals, or user-guided actions needed]

#### User Validation Protocol
Explicitly request user feedback: "Please review this summary carefully. I want to ensure I've understood your project correctly before breaking it into tasks:

#### Progression Decision
- **If corrections needed:** Incorporate user feedback and return to targeted inquiry if substantial gaps remain
- **If summary confirmed accurate:** Proceed to Phase 4 with user's explicit confirmation

**Mandatory Confirmation:** Do not proceed without explicit user approval of the project understanding.

### Phase 5: Final Synthesis and Asset Format Selection  
**Conditional Summary:** Include comprehensive context summary **only** if Phase 3 resulted in modifications, clarifications to gathered information or reiteration by the User.

**Final Confirmation:**
"Based on our complete discussion, do you think I have sufficient contextual understanding to proceed to planning? Is there anything critical I might be missing?"

**Asset Format Selection:**
In the same response, ask the user to choose an APM asset format:
- **Markdown**: Readable, concise, good for most projects (code, documents, analysis, feature-development)
- **JSON**: Structured, ~15% more tokens, use for complex projects with strict validation needs (BEING TESTED)

Explain both options briefly and confirm the user's choice.

## Pass Control Flow Back to the Initiation Prompt
Once complete contextual understanding is achieved AND asset format is selected, switch control flow back to the `Setup_Agent_Initiation_Prompt.md` prompt at the Implementation Plan + Memory Root Creation Phase.
